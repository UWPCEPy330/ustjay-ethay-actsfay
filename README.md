For this assignment, you're going to be working on a mashup! You'll use the code to scrape a random simile from [https://random-simile-generator.herokuapp.com/](https://random-simile-generator.herokuapp.com/) that we developed in class, and send it to a pig latin web application running on Heroku. The address of the Pig Latinizer is: [https://pig-latinizer.herokuapp.com/](https://pig-latinizer.herokuapp.com/)

The requirements are:
  * You should deploy your assignment to Heroku.
  * Whenever someone visits your home page, it should scrape a new simile, send that simile to the pig latin website, and print out the address for that piglatinized sentence on the home page.
